## Intro: from the plan to the form

During the design stage of the assessment, the team must consider how each data element collected will be compiled, aggregated, analysed and disseminated to satisfy the information needs. The data analysis plans allow the assessment team to identify data elements on data collection forms that are not analysable as well as information management requirements that have not been met.  Once missing data elements have been identified, forms can be amended accordingly by modifying, removing or adding data elements.

A common mistake for assessment teams is to collect too much data that is neither analysable nor will be used in decision making.  The temptation to ask too many questions means that teams gather poorer quality data which obstruct useful analysis.  If a data analysis plan shows that too much data will be collected, then data collection forms should be revised and shortened accordingly.

Each data element collected should be linked to:

* An information need linked to a Protection Topic
* Contextual information in relation with the Population Group (Refugees, IDPs)
* Data source - i.e. from aggregated Household Information, Key Informant or Focus Group discussions
* Type of Analysis: I.e. Correlation, Dispersion, Average,  
* Specific Protection indicator

## 

* Closing questions
* Skip patterns
* Ranges for selected questions
* Numbering questions
* Two questions in one
* Double negatives
* Clarity and simplicity
* Consultation
* Parcimony


##  The XLSFORM format

[XLSFROM](http://xlsform.org/) is a standard way to describe a form. It includes information not only on the type of questions but also on:

* Hints in order to add comments on methodology
* Contraints to avoid entering uncorrect information 
* Relevant to allow for skip logic
* Support for multiple language
* Possibility to perfom calculation for data quality checking
* Possibility to repeat the same questions in a loop.


##  Filtering the questions

The question library is an [online google spreasheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zGnaLXouP9vTfjqVvUVOSfzeSkvpd63f8Z-zvqGJtNU) where a sries of questions are organised around multiple categories

To use it, simply copy or donwload the library,  filter out the question you are not interested in and delete them.

The next step will be then to [customise the form](Guidelines-for-Customisation.html)


## A note on question types

### Likert questions

[Likert scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale) also called "opininion scale" desribe a way to formulate questions related to opinion. A Likert item is simply a statement that the respondent is asked to evaluate by giving it a quantitative value on any kind of subjective or objective dimension, with level of agreement/disagreement being the dimension most commonly used.

**Rating questions** are often much easier to understand by individual than **ranking questions** where  people may be forced to make one item worse or better than another, when they actually find them equal. Psychological research has proven that itâ€™s a very tough thing for people to rank more than three options. When people are given a cognitively difficult task like ranking question choices of for instance six things, often they will end up getting frustrated and will start to rank choices randomly. This will lead to higher dropout rates and even worse, messy data. 

Likert questions allows for each individual parts to have the same value, if that is how people feel about them. Last the analysis of rating is more intuitve than the one of a rank that in addition might not have much statistical significance. Also from likert questions, it's possible  to compute an average score from each separate ratings in order to get an overall ranking through a [Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count).
