Translate assessment results into programmatic response recommendations is challenging when it comes to protection activities. 

The analysis of vulnerabilities allows to generate protection activities recommandation.

The analysis of vulnerabilities is complex as it should allow to understand:

 * How **multiple vulnerabilities** interact between each other (prioritisation through criticality)?
 * What is, for **each vulnerability type**, the specific profile of a population group in terms of magnitude and severity?

Translate assessment results into programmatic response recommendations is challenging when it comes to protection activities. 

## The Right based approach 

Protection programme are designed according to the [Right Based approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights-based_approach_to_development). As such, more than the needs, it is the vulnerability of specific population group toward right violation that informs ressources allocation.

Vulnerability level for each specific risk =
function(risk **occurrence**) +
function(**exposure** to risk of basic right violation) +
function(**coping capacity** before or after violation)


Protection activities for UNHCR:  

 - Prevent occurrence of basic right violation event (**Environment Building actions**) && 
 - Limit the effects of violation events consequences (**Remedial actions**) && 
 - Respond to basic right violation event  (**Responsive actions**) 


Protection analysis is therefore linked to specific events linked to specific Right groups defined by UNHCR Result Based management.

Rights Group                                    | Basic right type                       | Violation event
----------------------------------------------- |--------------------------------------- | ------------- 
__Favourable Protection Environment__           | Non-refoulement                        | Non-admission, Refoulement
-                                               | No discrimination                      | Detention
-                                               | Freedom of movement                    | Eviction, deportation

__Community Empowerment and Self Reliance__     | Livelihood                             | Negative coping mechanism (Prostitution, child labour, early marriage, begging, stealing,.)
-                                               | Peaceful co-existence                  | Intercommunity violence
__Basic Needs and Essential Services__          | Education                              | Children out of school

__Security from Violence and Exploitation__     | Age, gender and diversity mainstreaming| Sex & Gender based violence, child abuses



## Vulnerability Profile

On each topic, the protection assessment should allow to identify the affected populationâ€™s vulnerability profile:

* Threat in terms of   __criticality__ , i.e how important is the threat compared to other. This is measured through priority ranking.
* Threat  in terms of occurence in order to define __magnitude__ 
* Capacities and capabilities in order to define  __severity__ -- "Severity" (or intensity) expresses the degree of unmet needs (it is thus related to shortages and deficits,  as  opposed  to  fulfillment  and  wellbeing) or the egree of something harmful,
harsh, stern, irreversible or not desirable. As such it is expressed through a form of rating.


The vulnerability profile (combination of criticality/magnitude/severity) for each topic will allow to prioritise the relevant activities. [Severity and Priority](http://aldo-benini.org/Level2/HumanitData/Benini_forACAPS_SeverityAndPriority_2013.pdf) are therefore appropriate way to measure vulnerability.

The risk profile will help designing the best intervention approach for each group:

Activity	                     | Criticality |	Magnitude | Severity
------------------------------ |------------ | ---------- |------------ 
Environment Building actions   |  	++       | 	  +       | 	-
Remedial actions               | 	  +        | 	  ++      | 	+
Responsive actions             | 		 +       |     -      | 	++
