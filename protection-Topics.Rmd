<div class="important">

Vulnerability level for a specific risk =
function(risk **occurrence**) +
function(**exposure** to risk of basic right violation) +
function(**coping capacity** before or after violation)

wich helps to distinguish 

Protection activities for UNHCR = 
Prevent occurrence of basic right violation event (**Environment Building actions**) && 
Limit the effects of violation events consequences (**Remedial actions**) &&
Respond to basic right violation event  (**Responsive actions**)
</div>

Protection analysis is therefore linked to specific events linked to specific Right groups defined by UNHCR Result Based management.

Rights Group                                    | Basic right type                       | Violation event

__Security from Violence and Exploitation__     | Age, gender and diversity mainstreaming| Sex & Gender based violence, child abuses


<div class="note">
On each topic, the protection assessment should allow to identify the affected populationâ€™s vulnerability profile:

* Capacities and capabilities in order to define __criticality__ 
* Threat  in terms of occurence in order to define __magnitude__ 
* Threat  in terms of exposure in order to define __severity__


The vulnerability profile (combination of criticality/magnitude/severity) for each topic will allow to prioritise the relevant activities.
