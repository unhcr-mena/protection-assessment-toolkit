##  Why "pre-testing"?

Use pre-test to see:

 * 	if changes have affected the flow of the questionnaires;
 * 	if response categories are comprehensive; any answer falling into the “other (specify)” category of a multiple choice question and that constitutes about 5 percent or more of all answers to that question should be considered as a serious candidate for a separate answer category of its own; and
 * 	if translated questionnaires are working.
