<div class="important">
Whether it is for the data collection or the analysis, protection assessment are often done in partnership. To avoid confusion and misunderstnading within the proces, it is recommended to establish a clear Memorandum of Understanding
</div>

## Implementation Model

According to the particular context, the assessment might be implemented using une of the following models :

*	Assigning full data collection responsibility to different agencies in different geographic areas
*	Pooling human and logistical resources centrally
*	Delegating data collection responsibilities to one or more NGO partners, ideally local NGOs, through a project agreement.

Regardless of the model chosen, it is important to observe four principles:

*	The objectives and methodology of the asessment need to be decided by consensus among particpant. Agencies who assume particular data collection responsibilities do not acquire a privileged say in choosing indicators, sites or data collection methods.  
*	Particpant contribute resources to the implementation of the asessment, to the measure of their capacities and possibilities.   
*	Common standards and understanding of assessment questions need to be agreed and maintained.  
*	Clear focal points need to be appointed per each particpating organisation with operational responsibility for data collection.
