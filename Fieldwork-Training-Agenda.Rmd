##  Training

Training of survey teams is fundamental for the quality of the survey information collected and preparation for the training and survey will take time, especially the first year the full assessment is implemented.

The training for the full assessment is recommended to last at least 2 days, depending on context and team experience. Extra staff should be trained in case someone is unable to perform the field work.
